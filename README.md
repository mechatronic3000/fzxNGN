# fzxNGN
2D physics engine written in and for QB64
I've made some demos for the physics engine ("fzxNGN") that I've been working for the last few years. Its a port of the Impulse engine written by Randy Gaul. Its been 100% ported to QB64 and not a 3rd party wrapper.

The idea of the "fzxDemo.bas" demo is a mini game to cross the sketchy bridge and then make the loop-to-loop. Beware the sketchy bridge will break. The more red the bridge is, the more stress its under. 
This was in part a test of a game mechanic I was kicking around for a driving/platformer.

The "fzxNGNBareBones.bas" is what it says a bare minimum implementation of the physics engine.

There are increasing number of demos, most do not require assets. Enjoy!

# Rougue Like
My new rougelike game is also here. I will try to update this readme with more about it when time allows.
